# Become a Software Professional 2023

The company MEGA ROCKET SA is a gym with partners and employees that asked us for the development of a web system that facilitates the monthly management of its schedule grid and the coaches in charge of each class, in such a way that their members can sign up dynamic without exceeding the available quotas.The system has a main screen (Landing) with different sections, and which is contained in this repository.

In this course to become a software professional in web/mobile programming technologies, you will find a brief description of the development and activities during the development of the course.

## What will I find inside this repository?
Inside here are the files of the project of the web page based on the landing page of the Figma screenflow. They are divided into weeks: 
- Week-02 merely contains the semantic structure of the web page.
- Week-03 contains this HTML structure styled with CSS using the pixel perfect method.
- Week-04 contains this HTML structure styled with CSS using Responsive design with Mobile First method. You can find this design in [link](https://glevide.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-04)
- Week-05. You can find these exercises in [link](https://glevide.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-05)

## Technology contained in this repository

Until now, you will find:
- HTML
- CSS with the pixel perfect method
- CSS with Responsive design with Mobile First method

## Development of the course through the weeks

### Week 01

- Tour of the history of web technology development.
- They taught us the stages and work methodologies to develop a programming project.
- With my teammates, we developed a website screenflow using Figma. In the process, I learned about the relevance of teamwork and internal communication with its members to achieve the goal.
- Thanks to the asynchronous material, and the help provided by tutors and teammates, we were able to learn to work with Figma, and to exploit the most relevant features of this powerful tool.

### Week 02

- We learned to create a local and remote repository, to work our projects using Git & GitHub. And now I'm using a remote repository I created on GitHub to share the weekly problem files.
- We learned about the structure and function of HTML programming for web project development. We conclude by forming the structure of the index.html file, merely semantics, following the design of the landing page that was developed in the screenflow of the problem of Week 01.

### Week 03
- We understood the complexity and scope of CSS style sheets, through the development of the CSS file related to the index.html file of the landing page done last week.
- We had to restructure the HTML document to be able to style it using css, without implementing methods like flexbox yet. 
- We implemented a CSS design using the pixel perfect method, without making the page responsive, for a display size of 1512.

### Week 04
- We had to restructure the HTML document to be able to style it using a Responsive web design, implementing flexbox methods. 
- We learned to create a Responsive Web using Breakpoints through media query and Flexible Layout applying the knowledge acquired from flexbox.
- A Mobile First design was applied for the development of the problem.
- We learned to work with the GitHub Pages. You can find this design in [link](https://glevide.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-04)

### Week 05
- You can find these exercises in [link](https://glevide.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-05)
