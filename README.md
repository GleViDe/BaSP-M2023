# Become a Software Professional 2023

Course to become a software professional in web/mobile programming technologies. Here you will find a brief description of my development and activities during the development of the course.

## Week 01

- I learned about the history of web technology development.
- I understood what are the stages and work methodologies to develop a programming project.
- With my teammates, we developed a website screenflow using Figma. In the process, I learned about the relevance of teamwork and internal communication with its members to achieve the goal.
- Thanks to the asynchronous material, and the help provided by tutors and teammates, I was able to learn to work with Figma, and to exploit the most relevant features of this powerful tool.

## Week 02

- I learned to create a local and remote repository, to work my projects using Git & GitHub. And now I'm using a remote repository I created on GitHub to share the weekly problem files.
- I learned about the structure and function of HTML programming for web project development. I am currently designing the structure of the index.html file, following the design of the landing page that was developed in the screenflow of the problem of Week 01.
